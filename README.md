Super-simple, single header C++ wrapper around libmicrohttpd

Based on gist: https://gist.github.com/artur-kink/96fffe58ddb7e4b081f6

Reason to make it separate repository is to:
* better control source while adding to multiple projects
* having simple, header-only C++ API interface to libmicrohttpd
