# lmhpp
Super-simple, single-header **libmicrohttpd** C++ wrapper.

Based on gist: https://gist.github.com/artur-kink/96fffe58ddb7e4b081f6

Reason to make it separate repository is to:
* better control source while adding to multiple projects
* easy interface to libmicrohttpd

Just don't forget it's intentionally very simple. You can extend it
as you wish, also PRs are welcome.

# Install
Only file you really need is `include/lmhttpd.hpp`. Add it to your project,
and enjoy.
